# snake-game
Summary: this is a fun learning java based snake game project making use of Java Swing and AWT libraries

- GUI Development: Built a graphical user interface using Java Swing and AWT, utilizing JFrame for the window structure and JPanel for the game canvas.
- Object-Oriented Design: Applied OOP principles such as inheritance (extending JPanel) and encapsulation. Implemented a custom inner class to handle specific keyboard events via the KeyAdapter class.
- Game Logic & Algorithms: Engineered the core game engine using arrays to track coordinate movements and implemented collision detection algorithms to handle boundary and self-intersection rules.
- Event Handling: Utilized the ActionListener interface and Timer class to manage the runtime loop and dynamic rendering of graphics

Future scope: Add more funtionalities
  1) Add restart game when game overs
  2) Bug: while moving in a direction say Right if you press both directions (Up and Left) OR (down and Left) button the game quits. ( I assume its pretty hard to fix. Lets see)
  3) Make the game more dynamic. i.e move the snake fast at first and when its size get big slow its movement
  4) Add levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  5) Add obstacles
  6) Show a win page

The same game made using vibe-coding.😭 https://ccsnake.lovable.app
