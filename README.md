# snake-game
Summary: this is a fun learning java based snake game project making use of Java Swing and AWT libraries

Future scope: Add more funtionalities
  1) Add restart game when game overs
  2) Bug: while moving in a direction say Right if you press both directions (Up and Left) OR (down and Left) button the game quits. ( I assume its pretty hard to fix. Lets see)
  3) Make the game more dynamic. i.e move the snake fast at first and when its size get big slow its movement
  4) Add levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  5) Add obstacles
  6) Show a win page

The same game made using vibe-coding.😭 https://ccsnake.lovable.app
